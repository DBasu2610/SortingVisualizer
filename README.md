# 🔢 Sorting Visualizer (Java Swing)

An interactive **sorting algorithm visualizer** built with **Java Swing**, designed to demonstrate how various sorting algorithms work through **real-time animations** and an intuitive UI.


## ✨ Features

- 🔄 **Real-time visualization** of sorting steps
- 🧠 Implements :
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
- 🎨 **Color-coded animation**: comparisons, swaps, and sorted regions
- 🎛 **UI controls**:
  - Start / Reset
  - Select algorithm via dropdown
  - Adjust array size
- 🧱 Built using **OOP principles**: modular, extensible, and clean codebase
